  volume = {21},
  issn = {0197-2456},
  abstract = {We describe an interactive Fortran program which performs computations related to the design and analysis of group sequential clinical trials using Lan-DeMets spending functions. Many clinical trials include interim analyses of accumulating data and rely on group sequential methods to avoid consequent inflation of the type I error rate. The computations are appropriate for interim test statistics whose distribution or limiting distribution is multivariate normal with independent increments. Recent theoretical results indicate that virtually any design likely to be used in a clinical trial will fall into this category. Interim analyses need not be equally spaced, and their number need not be specified in advance. In addition to determining sequential boundaries using an alpha spending function, the program can perform power computations, compute probabilities associated with a given set of boundaries, and generate confidence intervals.},

  issn = {1099-0992},
  abstract = {Running studies with high statistical power, while effect size estimates in psychology are often inaccurate, leads to a practical challenge when designing an experiment. This challenge can be addressed by performing sequential analyses while the data collection is still in progress. At an interim analysis, data collection can be stopped whenever the results are convincing enough to conclude that an effect is present, more data can be collected, or the study can be terminated whenever it is extremely unlikely that the predicted effect will be observed if data collection would be continued. Such interim analyses can be performed while controlling the Type 1 error rate. Sequential analyses can greatly improve the efficiency with which data are collected. Additional flexibility is provided by adaptive designs where sample sizes are increased on the basis of the observed effect size. The need for pre-registration, ways to prevent experimenter bias, and a comparison between Bayesian approaches and null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) are discussed. Sequential analyses, which are widely used in large-scale medical trials, provide an efficient way to perform high-powered informative experiments. I hope this introduction will provide a practical primer that allows researchers to incorporate sequential analyses in their research. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Simulation, using 1378 practical regression examples found in 44 experimental papers, shows that these corrections render the test statistics nearly exact in the face of ideal iid normal errors and provide large improvements in the accuracy of statistical inference in the presence of distinctly non-iid non-normal errors.},
